# Co-VR
Colocated Virtual Reality or Co-VR centers around creating virtual reality experiences that involve players in the same physical and virtual space. Players can interact and see each other in the virtual world, while only being feet apart. We created this github repo and associated unity package to help other Unity Virtual Reality developers to create Co-Located Experiences in Virtual Reality. We hope this addition to your toolset will help add more exciting and groundbreaking virtual reality experiences to the community.
