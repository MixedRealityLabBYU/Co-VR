# Co-VR
Co-Located Virtual Reality, or Co-VR, centers around creating VR experiences that map players in the same physical and virtual space. Players can interact and see each other in the same virtual world while only being feet apart. We created this Unity package and associated documentation to help other Unity VR developers to create Co-Located Experiences in Virtual Reality. We hope this tool will help add more exciting and groundbreaking VR experiences to the community.
